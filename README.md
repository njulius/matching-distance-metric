# Matching Estimators with a general distance metric

Code pertaining to simulations of matching with data-driven selection of the distance measure.

# R versus STATA

Abadie & Imbens provide a matching estimator implementation in STATA (`nnmatch`), but not in R. For R simulations, I use the `MatchIt` package developed by King et al.
